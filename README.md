## General Features

Learn more about the rich features of the Livecode extension:

- Linting
- Format your code
- Syntax highlighting
- Go to definition (across opened documents)
- Outline
- Breadcrumbs
- Livecode builder support



## Usage

Install the [VSCode Livecode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FerrusLogic.livecodescript).



**This extension requires Livecode server in order to support linting and formatting**.

Download and install livecode-server. When the plugin is loaded it will ask for Livecode-server executable. 

For Livecode builder (lcb) linting you will also need to specify executable for lcb compiling on the settings, search for LCBCompilerPath
